# Black_hole_merger_simulation
In my free time, i tried making a black hole merging simulation on MATLAB, simulating two black holes orbiting and merging using Newtonian gravity. It calculates orbital decay via a velocity damping factor, tracks their converging trajectories, and replaces them with a single larger mass once they collide.
